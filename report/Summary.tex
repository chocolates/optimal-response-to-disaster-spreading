To summary, we mainly have done these things in our work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reproduce the results in \cite{buzna2007efficient}
	\item Model disaster spreading as an PDE-constrained optimization problem and come up with two objective functions corresponding to different optimal criteria
	\item Find the optimal strategy to distribute external resources given the network topology, by solving this optimization problem using adjoint method
	\item Compare the optimal strategies with six heuristic strategies in \cite{buzna2007efficient} on grid and scale-free networks. 
\end{itemize}

We would suggest that further work could be done to study more representative setting of objective function,  e.g. a weighted sum of the two functions proposed in our work. Also one could study the influence of different network topologies and initial breaking nodes location on the optimized strategy. This might give us more insights into how to prevent and stop the spreading of disasters. Moreover, the amount of available resources is also an important parameter which will influence our solution.
