To sum up, we have mainly done these things in our work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reproduce the results in \cite{buzna2007efficient}
	\item Model disaster spreading as an PDE-constraint optimization problem and come up with two objective functions corresponding to different optimal criteria
	\item Find the optimal (may be local optimum, due to the inheritance of optimization method) strategy to distribute external resources given the network topology, by solving this optimization problem using adjoint method 
	\item Compare the optimal strategies with these six heuristic strategies on grid and scale-free networks. 
\end{itemize}

What could do further is to analyze more the optimal strategy. This may give us more understanding to control disaster.
