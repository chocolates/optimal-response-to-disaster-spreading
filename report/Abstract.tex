Efficient response and decision making are very important when disaster happens. In order to control disaster spreading, several heuristic strategies have been proposed to distribute external resources optimally \cite{buzna2007efficient}. We examine these heuristic strategies on different type of networks. Moreover, we model this problem as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, which is solvable by the adjoint method when topology properties of the network is given a-prior. Solution of this optimization problem gives an optimal strategy for resource distribution with respect to a certain objective function. Results show that the converged optimal strategy is much more effective than these existed heuristic strategies.
