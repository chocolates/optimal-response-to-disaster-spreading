\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Modeling: } we read paper and find out what to do together. Particularly, Jiawen proposed the adjoint method and derivated the formula used for optimization.
	\item \textbf{Implementing: } Jiawen and Zhichao implement the simulation of disaster spreading independently. After validing the correctness of our code, Jiawen implement the codes solving optimization problem.
	\item \textbf{Writing: } we write the report together.
\end{itemize}
